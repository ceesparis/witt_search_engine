**problem statement**

Most of the work of the late philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has remained unpublished to this day. Consequentially, any thoroughgoing research into his thought or life has to delve into his unpublished work. The methods that are currently in place to search this large body of chronologically ordered, but otherwise unorganised work are  lacking in ways that impede focused philosophical research. 

**proposed solution**

This application will offer an alternative search engine for the unpublished work of Wittgenstein. The focus of this engine will be to optimize the search engine specifically for philosophical research.
