# Process

## Week 1
- Created first small JSON-file database from a single manuscript xml-file.
- Created prototype which was functional for searching single words or strings of words.
- Was still very slow when dealing with large number of results.
- created a time-range bar, so the user can filter on time period. 

## Week 2
- Implemented strict search(only search for the word itself, not for words in which the word occurs)
- created a graph of searchresults. 
- created a larger database containing 4000 fragments. 
- implemented disjunctive and conjunctive search
- fixed performance issues by using react-virtualized 

## Week 3
- fixed last bugs
- updated repository
